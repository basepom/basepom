                            basepom 12 (the required compiler API change made it through the

                            * use `basepom.check.skip-javadoc` to skip generation,
                              derives from now obsolete `basepom.javadoc.skip`.
                            * use `basepom.check.fail-javadoc` to fail on error,
                              derives from `basepom.check.fail-basic`.

                            yet support 5.4.x.
* 2016-04-29 - (foundation) Introduce `basepom.test.skip` to skip unit tests. This can

                            active by default but not validating plugin
                            and dependency management. Set the
                            <basepom.dependency-management.dependencies>
                            and </basepom.dependency-management.plugins>
                            switches if needed.

                           Findbugs managed to finally jump the shark by declaring
                           dependencies on jsr305 and jcip jars *AND* including the same
                           classes in the jar itself, therefore ensuring that the class
                           path will always contain duplicates.

## Version 16

## Version 14

Maintaining a central set of dependencies for a wide variety of
projects using all different types of dependencies has turned out to
be a losing proposition. This should be done in an organization pom,
not in the base project. Therefore, with this release, the 'standard'
and 'standard-oss' poms are now **DEPRECATED**.

Starting with this release, the dependency versions in the 'standard'
pom are no longer updated.

Projects using either of those are highly encouraged to move the
dependency management section in the 'standard' pom to their own
project (and keep only the dependencies that are actually used) and
then switch to the 'minimal' or 'minimal-oss' pom.

Sometime in a future release, the 'standard' and 'standard-oss' poms
**WILL BE REMOVED WITHOUT REPLACEMENT**.

* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Fix longstanding typo for report encoding (exposed by the
                            failsafe plugin).
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Add failsafe plugin configuration for integration tests.
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Rename basepom.it.folder to basepom.invoker.folder to make
                            room for adding the failsafe plugin for integration testing.
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Add coverage back to extended checks (jacoco fixed their bug).
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Change verbosity of the git-id plugin. Fixes #21.
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade pmd to 5.4.0 (from 5.3.4)
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade checkstyle to 6.12.1 (from 6.10.1)
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade clean plugin to 3.0.0 (from 2.6.1)
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade surefire plugin to 2.19 (from 2.18.1)
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade shade plugin to 2.4.2 (from 2.4.1)

## Version 13

* 2015-09-19 - (foundation) Add the modernizer-maven-plugin 1.4.0
                            Not activated by default.
* 2015-09-18 - (foundation) Remove -Werror from compiler options. It
                            was not possible to turn Werror off or
                            override it which is really inconvenient.
                            If your projects relied on Werror being
                            present, re-add it either to your cor-
                            porate POM or the project POM itself.
                            Waiting for https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-compiler/pull/14
                            to trickle through the maven ecosystem to
                            allow turning Werror on and off with a
                            flag.
* 2015-09-18 - (minimal) Remove JDK8 build profile for javadocs. This
                         clashes with toolchains use and will activate
                         erronously when building with a JDK8 driving
                         maven and JDK7 building the actual code.
* 2015-09-18 - (standard-oss) Remove JDK7 profile, no longer needed
                              with minimal maven == 3.3.1
