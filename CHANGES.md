# Changes

This is the changelog for the basepom project. It follows [Keep a Changelog v1.0.0](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Every release of this project is potentially incompatible to the previous one even though reasonable attempts are made to be drop-in compatible. There is only a major version number which is incremented with every release.

### Added

* added `basepom.site.scm.comment` to set the site checkin comment. Default is `Site checkin for project ${project.name} (${project.version})`

* added the `repack` plugin and introduced jar repackaging by using a `.repack-executable` file. This is a drop-in replacement for jar shading, except that only `${basepom.main-class}` is supported (not `${basepom.shaded.main-class}`).

### Changed

* Bump dependency-versions-check plugin to 4.0.0 (from 3.2.0)
* Bump duplicate-finder plugin to 2.0.1 (from 1.5.1)
* Bump asciidoctor plugin to 2.2.4 (from 2.2.3)

* Bump dependency-scope plugin to 1.0.1 (from 0.10)
* Bump project-info-reports plugin to 3.4.4 (from 3.4.3)
* Bump checkstyle to 10.12.0 (from 10.11.0)

This release replaces the Hubspot dependency-management and
dependency-scope plugins with forked plugins under the
`org.basepom.maven` moniker. As the hubspot plugins appear to be
dormant, this was done to address the various maven 3.9.x warnings and
consolidate upgrading and releasing the plugins.

The `${basepom.shaded.main-class}` property is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the `${basepom.main-class}` property instead.

## 53 - 2023-05-12

### Added

* Add `basepom.test.arguments` and `basepom.it.arguments` to provide additional argline arguments to unit tests and integration tests.

### Changed

* Bump really-executable-jars plugin to 2.1.1 (from 2.0.0)
* Bump deploy plugin to 3.1.1 (from 3.1.0)

* Bump project-info-reports plugin to 3.4.3 (from 3.4.2)
* Bump license plugin to 4.2 (from 4.2.rc3)
* Bump build-helper plugin to 3.4.0 (from 3.3.0)
* Bump gpg-plugin to 3.1.0 (from 3.0.1)
* Bump checkstyle to 10.11.0 (from 10.8.0)
* Bump asciidoctorj to 2.5.8 (from 2.5.6)
* Bump asciidoctorj-diagram to 2.2.8 (from 2.2.3)
* Bump dependency-analyzer to 1.13.2 (from 1.13.0)

* Deploy profiles (basepom.oss-release and basepom.deploy-release) should also skip integration tests.
* switch back to using the `basepom.deploy-release` by default. The Nexus plugin has too many bugs (https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-38079, https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-38262) which can only be fixed by sonatype because of their development model.

## 52 - 2023-03-02

### Added

* license plugin now ignores `.keepme` files
* nexus oss plugin (1.6.13)

### Changed

* Bump pmd to 6.55.0 (from 6.53.0)

* Bump enforcer plugin to 3.2.1 (from 3.1.0)
* Bump project-info reports plugin to 3.4.2 (from 3.4.1)
* Bump compiler plugin to 3.11.0 (from 3.10.1)
* Bump assembly plugin to 3.5.0 (from 3.4.2)

* Bump spotbugs plugin to 4.7.3.2 (from 4.7.3.0)

* for the license plugin, the `header`, `includes` and `excludes` properties are now wrapped in a license set. The old configuration was deprecated for a while and Maven 3.9 has started nagging about it. This affects any project that adds custom excludes or includes. The `basepom.license.header` property still works as before.
* the `oss` parent pom will now use the nexus oss staging plugin by default. A new profile, `basepom.deploy-release`, has been added that uses the maven deploy plugin. Suggested by @klausbrunner in #64.

### Fixed

* Changed default value for `basepom.test.fork-count` from `1.0C` to `0.75C`.
* Replaced `basepom.it.parallel` and `basepom.failsafe.fork-count` with `basepom.it.fork-count` with a default of `0.5C`.
* Replaced `basepom.failsafe.timeout` with `basepom.it.timeout`.
* Moved jacoco agent preparation from the `initialize` to the `process-test-classes` phase. Too bad that there is no `pre-test`.
* Moved integration test jacoco agent preparation into the integration test profile.
* Bump basepom policy to 10 (from 9)
* Bump spotbugs plugin to 4.7.1.1 (from 4.7.1.0)

* Invoker plugin now uses `basepom.it.timeout` for test execution.

### Removed

* Removed `basepom.check.skip-javadoc` again; javadoc does not really align to the checkers (except for failure), generation is often controlled separately.
* Removed plugins that do not contribute default goals to the lifecycle and are not explicitly configured. Those plugins are still configured in the `<pluginManagement>` section.
* The `java.security.egd` setting for unit tests is no longer needed (since Java 8).

## 46 - 2022-07-16

### Changed

* Bump invoker plugin to 3.3.0 (from 3.2.2)
* Bump pmd plugin to 3.17.0 (from 3.16.0)
* Bump failsafe plugin to 3.0.0-M7 (from 3.0.0-M6)
* Bump surefire plugin to 3.0.0-M7 (from 3.0.0-M6)
* Bump site plugin to 4.0.0-M2 (from 4.0.0-M1)
* Bump enforcer plugin to 3.1.0 (from 3.0.0)
* Bump release plugin to 3.0.0-M6 (from 3.0.0-M5)
* Bump assembly plugin to 3.4.1 (from 3.3.0)
* Bump spotbugs plugin to 4.7.1.0 (from 4.7.0)
* Bump pmd to 6.47.0 (from 6.45.0)
* Bump checkstyle to 10.3.1 to (from 10.2)
* Bump spotbugs to 4.7.1 (from 4.7.0)

* spotbugs now supports multiple exclusion files. This version changes the default exclusion setup in the `minimal` and `oss`:

Old:
```xml
  <excludeFilterFile>spotbugs/spotbugs-suppress.xml</excludeFilterFile>
```

New:

``` xml
<excludeFilterFiles>
    <excludeFilterFile>spotbugs/spotbugs-suppress.xml</excludeFilterFile>
</excludeFilterFiles>
```

If a project supplies its own spotbugs exclusion file, it can no longer rely on overwriting the default file by setting the `excludeFilteFile` property but must do

``` xml
<excludeFilterFiles combine.children="overwrite">
    <excludeFilterFile>... new exclusion files ...</excludeFilterFile>
</excludeFilterFiles>
```

Otherwise, the default exclusion file will be loaded in addition to any project specific files. There are only very few exclusions (see [this file](https://github.com/basepom/basepom-policy/blob/master/src/main/resources/spotbugs/spotbugs-suppress.xml) for a full list) so this might not be a big problem.

* Bump project-info-reports plugin to 3.3.0 (from 3.2.2)
* Bump property-helper plugin to 3.0 (from 2.0)
* Bump policy jar to 9 (from 8) to suppress noisy new spotbugs checks
* Change `basepom.site.check.skip-*` properties to `basepom.site.skip-*` properties.
* Cleanup site reports

### Added
* Add suppression of noisy 4.7.x spotbugs annotations to the minimal pom.
* Add workaround for MDEP-804 to minimal pom
* Use hardcoded `src/it` folder to activate invoker integration test profiles (maven limitation)



## 44 - 2022-04-30

This release finally updates the dependency plugin post 3.1.2, thus enabling Java 17 support. However, the behavior with test dependencies has changed from the 3.1.2 release. If a build reports large numbers of *Non-test scoped test only dependencies found* problems, this is due to the new behavior.

The recommended fix from the Apache Maven team is either to add these dependencies to the `ignoredNonTestScopedDependencies` configuration which is brittle and cumbersome or to change the scope of these dependencies to `test` which may break for many reasons, especially in larger projects. Changing the scope also clashes with the dependency-scope plugin so this must be temporarily disabled with `<basepom.check.skip-dependency-scope>true</basepom.check.skip-dependency-scope>`.

There is a fix proposed as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MDEP-804. Once that has been merged and released, the old behavior can be restored.

### Added

* create report set for javadoc site
* new controls for site reports (`basepom.site.check.skip-...` and `basepom.site.test.skip`) to control site report generation independently from main report generation. All settings default to the parent (`basepom.check.skip-...` and `basepom.test.skip`) values.

## Version 32 - 2019-12-06

This version is identical to version 31, except that it requires a JDK 9+ as the system JDK (the JDK that runs maven). If the build can not be run on JDK 9+, basepom 31 has identical functionality. It no longer supports the toolchain plugin.

### Changed

* Requires JDK 9+ as the system JDK. Most important change is switching from `<source>` and `<target>` for the compiler plugin to `<release>`. This switch, which is only available in JDK 9+, allows correct compilation for all older versions of Java (6, 7, 8 etc.) without the need to provide a bootclasspath or the toolchain plugin. The resulting binaries will still be compatible with the given JDK (JDK 11, the current LTS version) supports 6 - 11.
* The values supported by the `project.build.targetJdk` have changed. 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 are no longer supported; the value must now be a single number (6 - the version of the current system JDK). Default is now `8` (was `1.8`).
* A new property `project.build.systemJdk` has been introduced. This specifies the minimal version (enforced by the enforcer)) here is now `9`.

### Removed

* The toolchain plugin has been removed.


## Version 31 - 2019-12-06

**IMPORTANT! THIS IS THE LAST BASEPOM RELEASE THAT SUPPORTS JDK 8 AS THE BUILD JDK! STARTING WITH VERSION 32, THE BUILD JDK MUST BE JDK9+ (THE TARGET JDK CAN STILL BE 7, 8 OR BETTER). WITH JDK 11 BEING THE DEFAULT LTS FOR ALMOST 15 MONTHS, SUPPORTING JDK 8 IS NO LONGER A PRIORITY!**

### Added

* Bump PMD to 6.20.0 (from 6.18.0)
* Bump checkstyle to 8.27.0 (from 8.25.0)

## Version 18

* 2016-04-29 - (foundation) Downgrade pmd to 5.3.6 (from 5.4.1). Maven plugin does not
                            yet support 5.4.x.
* 2016-04-29 - (foundation) Introduce `basepom.test.skip` to skip unit tests. This can
                            be used in a submodule to skip tests for that specific module.
* 2016-04-27 - (foundation) Introduce `basepom.build.maxheap-mb` as numeric equivalent
                            to `basepom.build.jvmsize`.

* 2016-04-25 - (foundation) Add the dependency-management-plugin 0.7
                            active by default but not validating plugin
                            and dependency management. Set the
                            <basepom.dependency-management.dependencies>
                            and </basepom.dependency-management.plugins>
                            switches if needed.
* 2016-04-15 - (foundation) Add 'basepom.git-id.fail-no-info' switch
* 2016-04-15 - (foundation) Upgrade git-commit-id plugin to 2.2.1 (from 2.2.0)
* 2016-04-12 - (oss)     - rename the "minimal-oss" pom to just "oss".
* 2016-04-06 - (minimal) - add an exception for findbugs-annotations vs. jcip-annotations.
                           Findbugs managed to finally jump the shark by declaring
                           dependencies on jsr305 and jcip jars *AND* including the same
                           classes in the jar itself, therefore ensuring that the class
                           path will always contain duplicates.

## Version 14

Maintaining a central set of dependencies for a wide variety of
projects using all different types of dependencies has turned out to
be a losing proposition. This should be done in an organization pom,
not in the base project. Therefore, with this release, the 'standard'
and 'standard-oss' poms are now **DEPRECATED**.

Starting with this release, the dependency versions in the 'standard'
pom are no longer updated.

Projects using either of those are highly encouraged to move the
dependency management section in the 'standard' pom to their own
project (and keep only the dependencies that are actually used) and
then switch to the 'minimal' or 'minimal-oss' pom.

Sometime in a future release, the 'standard' and 'standard-oss' poms
**WILL BE REMOVED WITHOUT REPLACEMENT**.

* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Fix longstanding typo for report encoding (exposed by the
                            failsafe plugin).
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Add failsafe plugin configuration for integration tests.
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Rename basepom.it.folder to basepom.invoker.folder to make
                            room for adding the failsafe plugin for integration testing.
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Add coverage back to extended checks (jacoco fixed their bug).
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Change verbosity of the git-id plugin. Fixes #21.
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade pmd to 5.4.0 (from 5.3.4)
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade checkstyle to 6.12.1 (from 6.10.1)
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade clean plugin to 3.0.0 (from 2.6.1)
* 2015-11-15 - (foundation) Upgrade surefire plugin to 2.19 (from 2.18.1)

## Version 13

* 2015-09-19 - (foundation) Add the modernizer-maven-plugin 1.4.0
                            Not activated by default.
* 2015-09-18 - (foundation) Remove -Werror from compiler options. It
                            was not possible to turn Werror off or
                            override it which is really inconvenient.
                            If your projects relied on Werror being
                            present, re-add it either to your cor-
                            porate POM or the project POM itself.
                            Waiting for https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-compiler/pull/14
                            to trickle through the maven ecosystem to
                            allow turning Werror on and off with a
                            flag.
* 2015-09-18 - (minimal) Remove JDK8 build profile for javadocs. This
                         clashes with toolchains use and will activate
                         erronously when building with a JDK8 driving
                         maven and JDK7 building the actual code.
* 2015-09-18 - (standard-oss) Remove JDK7 profile, no longer needed
                              with minimal maven == 3.3.1

* 2014-12-31 - (foundation) Switched from Ning duplicate-finder plugin to the
                            basepom plugin.
                            This is a breaking change and if a POM references
                            the old ning plugin, artifactId and groupId must be
                            updated!
* 2014-12-31 - (foundation) Removed basepom.check.phase-duplicate-finder property, as the
                            duplicate finder plugin runs on the classpath, it must be run in
                            verify phase.

                          - jaxrs: cbor, smile, xml
* 2014-12-31 - (standard) Added remaining guice extension modules:
                          - grapher, jmx, jndi, persist, spring, struts2, testlib

                          - jersey: atom
                          - jersey-contribs: spring, simple-server, scala
                          - jersey-test-framework: http, external
* 2014-12-31 - (standard) Added more jetty dependencies:
                          - io, xml, webapp, jndi, annotations, continuation, client, monitor, http-spi
